# TODO Tree

This is a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) that shows a sidebar listing all TODOs in your vault.

This is essentially a clone of the fantastic
[todo-tree](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Gruntfuggly.todo-tree) plugin for
VSCode. Written almost entirely with a combination of Claude Sonnet 4, GPT-4, Gemini 2.5.

## Features

- Lists all TODO, FIXME, and NOTE items in a sidebar view.
- Groups items by file.
- Clicking on an item opens the file and jumps to the corresponding line.

## How to use

- Install the plugin from the Obsidian community plugins browser.
- Open the command palette and run "Open TODO Tree".
- A sidebar will open with a list of all your TODOs.
- Use plugin settings to set which strings are considered TODOs.
